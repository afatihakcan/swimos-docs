## Build Apps with Ease

Swim applications are comprised of stateful web agents, which represent real-world objects, and streamlets, bits of application logic which continuously analyze streaming inputs, update their own state, and stream output over their links to other streamlets or to users and applications. By combining web agents and streamlets, Swim developers can quickly model even the most complex real-world systems, processes and environments.

## Example Apps

To try Swim, check out an example application, like Ripple, Traffic, Transit. Or clone a [starter application](https://github.com/swimos/tutorial) on which to base a new app.
